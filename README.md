Saving SHSH blobs does not require setting a nonce generator. Setting a nonce generator is only needed for the actual upgrade/downgrade process. (To set a nonce generator
you need a jailbreak. Currently, the latest jailbreak for all A7-A11 devices running iOS 12.0-12.4 is Unc0ver. The latest jailbreak that's A12(X) compatible is Chimera, which works
for all A7-A12(X) devices running iOS 12.0-12.1.2)
