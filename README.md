# SDIE (SHSH Device Info Extractor)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# IMPORTANT INFO

If you have an A5-A12X device, open 'SDIE.bat'

If you are UNSURE what device you have, visit https://bit.ly/2kepwpD

Only compatible with Windows Vista and newer (even Windows 10). No macOS/Linux support yet.

Saving SHSH blobs does not require setting a nonce generator. Setting a nonce generator is only needed for the actual upgrade/downgrade process. (To set a nonce generator you need a jailbreak. Currently, the latest jailbreak for all A7-A11 devices running iOS 12.0-12.4 is Unc0ver. The latest jailbreak that's A12(X) compatible is Chimera, which works
for all A7-A12(X) devices running iOS 12.0-12.1.2)

# IN CASE OF EMERGENCY:
