# SDIE (SHSH Device Info Extractor)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# IMPORTANT INFO AND INSTRUCTIONS

This is for all A5-13 devices running iOS 9.0-13.2.3 and any future iOS versions.

If you are UNSURE what device you have, visit https://bit.ly/2kepwpD

Compatible with Windows Vista and newer (even Windows 10) and macOS.

This program only extracts the information needed to save blobs and doesn't require a jailbreak, however, saving SHSH blobs REQUIRES setting a nonce generator, which does require a jailbreak. And keep in mind, this program does NOT save blobs. Again, it only extracts the information needed to do so.
